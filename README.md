Slam is a simple command-line utility that makes it very easy to do serverless
deployments of Python web applications that adhere to the WSGI protocol to 
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), using the [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) and
[API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) services.

If you have 10 minutes to spare, you can watch a screencast in which the main
features of slam are demonstrated:

Or if you prefer something more formal, have a look at the 
[documentation](http://slam-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which also
includes a written tutorial.
